- Setup your catkin workstation
- install cmake
- catkin_init_workspace
- Download vicon_bridge ROS package (http://wiki.ros.org/vicon_bridge)
- install cmake
- catkin_make
- set CATKIN_SOURCE_DIR
- set ROS_MASTER_URI in both PC and erlecopter to match PC IP address.

apm.service runs on boot, which calls ~/apm.sh which then runs ros.service, which calls /opt/ros/kinetic/setup-ros.bash
services are in /lib/systemd/system/
$systemctl start/stop/disable/enable/status apm.service

to run mavros on erlecopter:
roslaunch mavros apm.launch fcu_url:='udp://@127.0.0.1:6001'



(NOT TESTED)
To change IP address of ErleCopter:
/etc/network/interfaces
/etc/dnsmasq.conf
/opt/ros/kinetic/setup-mavros.bash
(where else??)


========
Erle_Controller

git clone erle_controller, mavros and mavros-msgs

in case catkin_make fails, you can do catkin_make clean, and remove build directory.

Setup ROS parameters in .bashrc
ROS_MASTER_URI

need to set SYSID_MYGCS to match FCU ID (1)



emergency kill command:
sudo kill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[A]rduCopter.elf' | awk '{print $2}')
